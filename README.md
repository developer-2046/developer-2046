## 🛰️ Professional Profile
Double-major in **Computer Science** and **Applied Mathematics** at the University of Utah.  
I design and ship production-grade systems that *learn, scale, and resist failure*—from a Java machine-learning library to a Rust back-tester and an entropy-driven market-regime detector. Comfortable jumping between low-level optimization, statistical theory, and full-stack delivery while writing documentation that humans actually read.:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
